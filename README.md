# FORCE-learning-in-cognitive-tasks

Python implementation of FORCE learning in Recurrent Neural Networks to replicate the activity of real biological neurons in a delayed match-to-sample task.
Data obtained from 'Discrete attractor dynamics underlies persistent activity in the frontal cortex', HK Inagaki, L Fontolan, 2019.
The FORCE implementation follows the one proposed in 'Recurrent Network Models of Sequence Generation and Memory', K Rajan, 2016.
